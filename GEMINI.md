# GEMINI Project Context: ServiTech

## Project Overview

This project is a client-side web application that simulates an online platform for hiring services. It's designed as a multi-page, interactive front-end experience without a backend.

**Core Technologies:**
*   **HTML5:** Provides the structure for the main page (`index.html`) and the shopping cart page (`cart.html`).
*   **CSS3:** Custom styling is located in `css/style.css`. It uses modern features like CSS variables for theming, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.
*   **JavaScript (jQuery):** All interactivity is handled using jQuery. Logic is separated by page into `js/main.js` and `js/cart.js`.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** Used for responsive layout, components (cards, modals, forms), and general styling. It is loaded via a CDN.

**Architecture:**
*   **Multi-Page Application:** The application is split into a main service listing page (`index.html`) and a dedicated shopping cart page (`cart.html`).
*   **Client-Side State:** The shopping cart's state is managed entirely on the client side using the browser's `localStorage`. This ensures the cart persists across page reloads and navigation between the home and cart pages.
*   **Theming:** A light/dark mode theme is implemented using a class (`.dark-mode`) on the `<html>` tag and CSS variables for colors. A blocking script in the `<head>` of each HTML file prevents the "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC) when loading in dark mode.

## Building and Running

**No Build Step Required.**

This is a static front-end project. There are no package dependencies to install or build scripts to run.

**Running the Project:**
1.  Serve the project directory using a local web server. A simple one can be run with Python:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, but using a local server is recommended for development to avoid potential issues with browser security policies (CORS).

**Testing:**
There are no automated tests. All testing should be performed manually by interacting with the application's features in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** All custom styles are in `css/style.css`. New styles should be added there and, where possible, should use the existing CSS variables for colors to ensure theme compatibility.
*   **JavaScript:**
    *   jQuery is the primary tool for DOM manipulation and event handling.
    *   Logic for `index.html` resides in `js/main.js`.
    *   Logic for `cart.html` resides in `js/cart.js`.
    *   The `cart` data structure is an array of objects stored as a JSON string in `localStorage` under the key `shoppingCart`.
*   **HTML:** The structure is based on Bootstrap 5 conventions. Dynamic content (like the service list and cart items) is generated by the JavaScript files.
*   **Data:** The list of available services is hardcoded as an array of objects at the top of `js/main.js`.
